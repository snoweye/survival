\title{Recreating a Royston and Altman paper}

\section{Introduction}
The paper by Royston and Altman \cite{Royston13b} on Cox model validation is
a delightfully clear exposition of the important principles.
As well, they made use of, and documented, data sets that others can use.
The \code{rotterdam} and \code{gbsg} data sets from their work have been
incorporated into the survival package.

This short note describes that process, and more importantly, attempts
to recreate some of the results of their paper as a way of validating that the
data was created correctly.

\section{Rotterdam data}
The main paper refers to a web site \code{www.stata-press.com/data/fpsaus.html}.
That in turn hosts all of the data sets and Stata code for a book
by Royston and Lampert \cite{Royston11}. 
Following the URL leads to a data set \code{rott2},
imported from a Stata file \code{rott2.dta}.  Variable labels make it 
fairly easy to set up the new data set.  There were a few variables
that we did not copy.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{mf, mfi}: time to metastisis
  \item \code{enodes}: exp(-0.12*nodes)
  \item \code{pr\_1} : log(pr +1)
  \item \code{enod\_1}: enodes*enodes
  \item \code{recent}:  year of surgery dichomized as $\le 1987$ (0) vs 
    $\ge 1988$ (1)
  \item \code{\_st}: 1 for all rows
  \item \code{\_d} : equal to \code{recur} if rtime < 10 years, 0 otherwise
  \item \code{\_t} : recurrence time, truncated at 10 years
  \item \code{\_t0}: 0 for all rows
\end{itemize}
The Rotterdam data contains 2982 subjects.

The article makes the statement that the endpoint for fits to the Rotterdam
data is relapse-free survival (RFS), the earlier of death or relapse, censored
at 84 months, and that they will omit those with nodes=0.
It also has the statement that ``The Rotterdam data (with RFS truncated to
120 months) can be downloaded from www.stat-press.com.'',
I expect this latter statement has caused many to assume that the 
\code{(\_t, \_d)} pair in that data set contains RFS values, but examination 
shows that they encode 10 year relapse.

Tabel 1 in the paper shows covariate distributions for 1546 subjects,
 the number with nodes > 0.
The values below, from the R data set, match the values in the table.

Table 1 shows the distribution for 1546 subjects, the number with nodes > 0.
The distribution below, from the R data set, matches the table with the
exception of the mean estrogen receptor (ER) level.  If I winsorize that
at 2000 to exclude large outliers, however, I match the table.

The Cox model in the paper was fit using fractional polynomials.  If we use the
RPS at 84 months = 7 years, the model fit looks like the following.
As noted in the help file for the rotterdam data, 
there are 43 subjects who have died without recurrence, but whose death
time is greater than the censoring time for recurrence;
and exactly how best to handle these is debatable.
Consider subject 191 who is censored for recurrence at 13 months, with death
at 52 months.  We could code this subject as censored at 13 or an RFS event at
52.
The latter implicitly assumes that there was no recurrence in the unobserved
period from 13 to 52 months, over 3 years.  
For a tertiary care center in the US, where a subject is likely to return to 
their home physician after the primary cancer treatment, this is not a tenable
assumption.  If they had recurred, we would not have found out about it due to
disjoint medical records systems, and the safer course is to censor at 13.
In a national health care system such as the Netherlands, where this study was
conducted, such an assumption is more reasonable.
In this case, ignoring the gaps and using the later death 
leads to 965 events, which matches the desciption on page 3 of the paper.

<<table2, echo=TRUE>>=
y7 <- round(7*365.25)  # 7 years or 84 months
r7 <- rotterdam2
r7$recur <- ifelse(r7$rtime > y7, 0, r7$recur)
r7$rtime <- pmin(r7$rtime, y7)
r7$death <- ifelse(r7$dtime > y7, 0, r7$death)
r7$dtime <- pmin(r7$dtime, y7)

r7$rfstime <- with(r7, ifelse(recur==1, rtime, dtime))  # time to recur or death
r7$rfs <- with(r7, pmax(death, recur)) 
table(r7$rfs)
agefun <- function(x) cbind((x/100)^3, (x/100)^3 * log(x/100))
cfit <- coxph(Surv(rfstime, rfs) ~ agefun(age) + meno + size + 
                    I(1/sqrt(nodes)) + I(er/1000) + hormon, 
              data= r7, ties="breslow")
cbind("cfit"= round(coef(cfit),3), 
      "paper"= c(1.07, 9.13, 0.46, 0.23, 0.31, -1.74, -0.34, -0.35))
@ 

The dataset is also available from Sauerbrei et al \cite{Sauerbrei07}.  That
version does not have the overall survival and death variables, but includes
two categorical variables \code{sized1} = 1 if size $>20$ and
\code{sized2} = 1 if size $> 50$, which match the variable names found 
in table 2, and resolves the coefficent difference we see above for the 
size > 50 group: our coefficient is the sum of the \code{sized1} and
\code{sized2} coefficients in their table.  
They had used contrasts of group 2 vs. 1 and 3 vs. 2, while we have 2 vs. 1
and 3 vs. 1.


A termplot reveals the non-linear age effect.  Both young and old
subjects are at higher risk.

<<termplot, fig=TRUE>>=
termplot(cfit, term=1, ylab="Estimated age effect", col.term=1, col.se=1,
         se=TRUE)

=======
The histogram of the risk scores is not a perfect match, either, 
but again very close in its overall form.

<<hist1, fig=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
PI1 <- predict(cfit) - mean(predict(cfit))
hist(PI1, breaks=seq(-1.5, 1.6, by=.1), xlab="Validation data", man=NULL)
@ 

An alternate explantion would be that the authors also used the derived
variables \code{\_t, \_d} that contain 120 month progression.  
The coefficients with that endpoint are far different, however.
We also tried censoring events at 2510 days, which gives 965 events, but that
leads to only minor changes in the coefficients and did not improve 
the agreement with table 1.  Likewise for the use of a winsorized value of er.
The exact reason for a count of 965 vs. 968 events remains obscure, but we
expect it is the underlying cause.

\section{GBSG data}
The GBSG data set found in the reference is somewhat simpler, in that it only
contains the RFS outcome.
The GBSG data set has no node-negative subjects, and tumor size is continuous
rather than being categorical.

The data set has again, exact agreement with table 1.

<<gbsg1, echo=TRUE>>=
table(cut(gbsg$size, c(0, 20, 50, 150), c("<=20", "20-50", ">50")))
table(gbsg$meno)
table(gbsg$hormon)
round(c(mean(gbsg$age), sd(gbsg$age)), 1)
round(c(mean(gbsg$nodes),sd(gbsg$nodes)), 1)
round(c(mean(gbsg$pgr), sd(gbsg$pgr)), 1)
round(c(mean(gbsg$er),  sd(gbsg$er)), 1)
@ 

Validation is made easier if we create a version of the GBSG data set whose
variable names exactly match the Rotterdam derivation data set.
Then create a PI variable using the rotterdam fit.

<<gbsg2>>=
gbsg2 <- gbsg
gbsg2$size <- cut(gbsg$size, c(0, 20, 50, 150), c("<=20", "20-50", ">50"))
gbsg2$rfs <- gbsg2$status

gbsg2$PI <- predict(cfit, newdata=gbsg2)
@ 

The histogram of the risk scores appears to match that in Figure 1. 

<<hist1, echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE>>=
PI1 <- predict(cfit) - mean(predict(cfit))
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(6,6,1,1))
hist(PI1, breaks=seq(-1.6, 1.6, by=.1), xlab="PI in derivation data", main=NULL)
abline(v = quantile(PI1, c(.16, .5 , .84)), col=2)

PI2 <- gbsg2$PI - mean(predict(cfit))
hist(PI2, breaks=seq(-1.6, 1.6, by=.1), xlab="PI in validation data", main=NULL)
abline(v = quantile(PI2, c(.16, .5 , .84)), col=2)
par(oldpar)
@ 

And here is figure 2, comparing the KM curves, by PI group.

<<fig2, fig=TRUE>>=
grp1 <- cut(PI1, quantile(PI1, c(0, .16, .5 , .84, 1)), include.lowest=TRUE)
km1 <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, rfs) ~ grp1, r7)
plot(km1, xscale=365.25, xlab="Years since enrollment", 
     ylab="Relapse free survival")
grp2 <- cut(PI2, quantile(PI2, c(0, .16, .5 , .84, 1)), include.lowest=TRUE) 
km2 <- survfit(Surv(rfstime, rfs) ~ grp2, gbsg2)
lines(km2, col=2)
@ 

The curves for the validation group have similar spread to those for the 
development data set.
The GBSG data set shows fewer early deaths than predicted; however, this
is not surprising.  
The Rotterdam study enrolled all breast cancer subjects while the GBSG data
is from a clinical trial, and cancer clincial trial subjects very often have an
initial ``death honeymoon'', for a variety of reasons:
eligibility criteria often explicitly ask for subjects with a minimal expected
survival, or implicitly so by excluding those with low Karnofsky scores, while
subjects who are in extremis are themselves less likely to volunteer.
