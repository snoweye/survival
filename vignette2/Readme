These are extra vignettes that are not in the vignettes directory.
Why:  sas.Rnw does timings, and is too slow
      tutorial.Rnw uses data from outside the survival package
      pseudo.Rnw requires a robust variance version of glm

Because they are not available in the package, I have created the pdf for some of
the entries.
